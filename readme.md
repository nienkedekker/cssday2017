## PPK: Constraint validation and form validation
Form validation is the oldest trick in the JS book. At first, it was the only thing that browsers could do.

* onkeypress: whenever the user changes part of the value. too soon, too many times
* onblur:  when the user leaves a form field. sweet spot
